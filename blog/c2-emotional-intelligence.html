  <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
  <p>I was dreading these videos, but I actually found them to be really useful and simple. I've always believed in my gut and the chapter explained why you have gut feelings and further encourages you to listen to your body in order to train your mindfulness. I really enjoyed that they backed up all of these skills with scientific evidence. I wasn't completely sold on meditation when we did our time and habits concepts, but I definitely want to try it now! </p>
 <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
 <p>I have to confess I actually fell asleep several times during the video and had to replay it about 5 times. I tried practicing mindfulness in the shower this morning and that was really soothing.</p>
