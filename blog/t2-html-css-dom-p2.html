  <h4>What is grid based design?</h4>
  <p>A website built using grid based design has a layout that is based on pre-set columns and rows.  It serves as a guide to place elements of a website. It also helps to create consistency within a site.</p>
 <h4>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</h4>
 <p>Due to the increasing development of technology, there is a wide spectrum of screen sizes and resolutions that a web developer must cater to. Instead of creating a different version of a website for each indivicual device, a responsive design will autmomatically adjust the layout of a website to make it look good based on the browser's width and resolution.</p>
 <h4>What is Semantic Structure?</h4>
 <p>Semantics structure is used to reinforce the meaning of content in a website. Semantic tags provide additional information about your document and for example, can optimizes search engines results. Semantic tags identify things like navigation, section, articles and time.</p>
 <h4>Interesting thoughts to reflect on</h4>
 <p>I think it's really interesting just how much HTML and CSS has evolved since the conception of the internet. We've gone through various versions of HTML and CSS and there is so much added functionality with each language. Considering how much the web will continue to evolve, I think web development is definitely an exciting place to be. </p>
