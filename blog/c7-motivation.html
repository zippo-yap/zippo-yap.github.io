          <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
          <p>
          Pleasure is in-the-moment happiness, but when you get used to it, you will need to find something else to give you that same level of happiness. Passion is finding yourself getting lost in something you're doing. Purpose is something that will give more meaning to your life and the work that you do and will bring you sustainable happiness in the long run.
          </p>
          <h4>What are your core values?</h4>
          <p>
            I was raised with family as a core value, and friends were always really important to me. In fact as I get older, I think loyalty has become more important to me regardless of whether it's friends, families or co-workers.
          </p>
          <h4>What do you stand for?</h4>
          <p>
            I feel really strongly about doing the right thing and being a good samaritan. I try to be as open-minded as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I really think about it, it all really comes down to empathy and being able to stop and put yourself in the other person’s shoes. From there with an open mind you can learn a lot about people and why they do the things they do, whether it be good or bad.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s crazy how selfish people have become or how people make the assumption that ‘someone else’ will do the right thing. Yesterday, we stopped to help a man who was having a seizure on the side of the road. Every single car before us had driven straight past him. I guess people we’re too busy or assumed someone else would stop or perhaps they thought it was a scam. My friend was in a similar situation recently where she came across a guy on the motorway having a seizure in his car in peak traffic. Everyone else was too busy getting angry at the car for blocking the road to stop and help. If we all thought that way, these poor guys would have been left to die.
          </p> 
          <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
          <p>
            I've been exposed to the idea of resilience before and I still think it's all very well being aware about it, but to really put it into practice is the hard part. I like the cognitive resilience idea and I think it's very similar to self-awareness. I'm not too keen on bringing up my failures in my meditation because I feel it goes against the don't feed your monsters concept, but I do understand that the idea is to learn how to go between feelings of failure to success and then inner calm.
