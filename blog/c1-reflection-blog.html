          <p>
           You always hear the phrase, “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life”. Yes, but what do I love doing? Not working. My main goal has always been happiness. Being happy was more important to me than a stressful career, so my goal became early retirement. I left university at 23, got a job and bought a house. Knowing that I could retire in 20 years and move somewhere rural with mountains in my backyard was a beautiful goal and I was happy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unfortunately, life doesn’t always happen the way we plan. Really – I should have known better. I had to sell the house and split the profits. Without the house, my early retirement plans were put on hold. The housing market skyrocketed thanks to overseas investors and I was left with no house, a job I wasn’t satisfied with and no clue what my next move would be. I wasn’t happy anymore and to be honest my lack of direction was really getting me down.
        </p> 
        <p>
          My partner suggested I look into coding, and the more I looked into it, the more I liked the idea. I researched a couple of my options:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Bachelor of Science – Computer Science, (3 years)</li>
          <li>Coding Bootcamp (18 weeks)</li>
          <li>Learn myself through online resources (unknown)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Dev bootcamp sounded like the perfect solution, but the costs associated with the course were high. I learn by doing, so I started using online resources and mobile apps.  I had no idea where to start and there were so many different coding languages. I tried out a few and felt like I wasn’t getting anywhere because I was trying to do everything all at once. The bootcamp idea continued to stick in my head. Could I do it? How would we afford to live on one income for half a year? In the end I applied for the bootcamp with a ‘What have I got to lose mentality’.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the biggest factors affecting how I look at my Dev Academy experience is knowing that my partner and I are making a lot of sacrifices so that I can do this programme. It's not just the money -it's also the time I spend sitting in front of my computer until bed time. Ensuring that I get the most out of Dev Acadamy and myself will make our sacrifices worthwhile. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It's a bootcamp, it's supposed to be hard.  The intensive workload will become a challenge as the weeks progress and I think it's really important to celebrate the little successes. Be okay with being uncomfortable because being uncomfortable comes with the teritory of learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's too early to say what my expectations of Dev Academy are at the moment, and I try to approach most things with an open mind, but hopefully the end goal, which I mentioned earlier, is to be able to build a career. I have a few ideas of things I'd like to build, so I'm hoping Dev Academy will help me get there in the next 17.5 weeks
        </p>
        <p>
          My background was in delivering online learning content to lawyers, so the concept of learning online is quite familiar to me. You have the flexibility to study in your own time and in your own style. I'm excited to get into pair programming. Overall, I'm just extremely excited to begin my Dev Academy experience. 
        </p>

          Cue, the next 6 months of a very broke me pursuing code :)
