    <h2>Reflections about time and habit techniques</h2> 
    <h3>Thursday, 17 March 2016</h3>
    <!-- which timebox and habits techniques did you try, -->
    <p>After going through the time and habit resources, I found that I was already doing similar things and a few techniques that clicked with me were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://blog.bufferapp.com/make-it-big-by-starting-small">Make it big by starting small:</a>
        <ul>
          <li>Instead of looking at the end goal, start with smaller more achievable goals</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8">Tiny Habits:</a>
         <ul>
          <li>Start a habit by doing something really minuscule e.g. 1 push-up</li>
        </ul>
        <li><a href="http://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity">Counter-intuitive productivity:</a>
         <ul>
          <li>This method really made me laugh because in reality I'm a lazy person and the faster I get something done, the earlier I can go do something else.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <!-- what did you find interesting? -->
      <p>Carol Dweck's explanation of the difference between 'Fixed and Growth' mindsets was really interesting. Her studies have shown that much of our success hinges on whether we believe in our potential for developing our abilities instead of believing they are fixed. </p>

      <!-- what worked for you? -->
      <p>I've found that making checklists of tasks to do means that the project is broken down into small achievable goals and I get immediate feedback for my small actions. It helps me break a task down into more manageable, less intimidating steps and as a result I also feel like I've accomplished more. I tend to do this for most things including chores at home.</p>

      <p>One of the things I've been doing for a while now is setting alarms at hourly intervals. The alarms remind me that I need to drink more water and they also serve as a reminder to take a break.</p>
      <!-- which will you experiment further with? -->
      <p>Acknowledging that in order to be productive you have to take time away from doing that thing that you're supposed to be working on is something I need to work on. I'm going to try these tips out too: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Counterintuitive Tip #5: Make It Painful Not To Do</li>
        <li>Counterintuitive Tip #6: Give Yourself Less Time</li>
      </ul>

   <p>Forcing myself to touch type has been a painful experience. It's slowly getting better, and hopefully by applying some of these tips, I'll end up as a unicorn typist.</p>
